# FileDownloader
A simple file downloader script in Python

Download the file through the file link like other download manager software, but with the appearance of terminal and CMD.

By running the script, you enter the link and file name, and the process of downloading the file will be displayed in CMD.

To display the exact file extension, it is better to complete the ct_list variable in the code file to support all extensions (content-type). If the desired extension is not in the ct_list dictionary, it may display a file formation error.

This is a simple file download script that can be used for personalized downloads on operating systems that do not support download manager software.

By using schedule and an external Jason file to record the settings and list of downloads, you can completely manage downloads like other download manager software.
